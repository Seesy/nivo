  description: |
    Generates a radial bar chart from an array of data.
    Note that margin object does not take grid labels into account,
    so you should adjust it to leave enough room for it.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveRadialBar`.

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.
